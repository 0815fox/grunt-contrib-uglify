## Overview

This task is a [multi task](types_of_tasks.md), meaning that grunt will automatically iterate over all `uglify` targets if a target is not specified.

grunt-contrib-uglify primarily delegates to [UglifyJS2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2), so please consider the [UglifyJS documentation](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/) as required reading for advanced configuration.
